            I'm through with standing in line to clubs I'll never get in
            It's like the bottom of the ninth, and I'm never gonna win
            This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
            (Tell me what you want)
            </p>
            <p>
            I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
            And a bathroom I can play baseball in
            And a king-size tub, big enough for ten plus me
            (Uh, so what you need?)
            </p>
            I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
            And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
            Gonna join the mile high club at 37, 000 feet
            (Been there, done that)
            <p>
            I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
            My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
            Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
            (So how you gonna do it?)
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
            I'd even cut my hair and changed my name
            'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
            And live in hilltop houses, driving 15 cars
            </p>
            <p>
            The girls come easy, and the drugs come cheap
            We'll all stay skinny, 'cause we just won't eat
            And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
            In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
            </p>
            <p></p>
            Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
            Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair and, well
            Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
            Hmm, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
            </p>
            <p>
            I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
            Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
            Sign a couple autographs, so I can eat my meals for free
            (I'll have the quesadilla, haha!)
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
            Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
            Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
            (So how you gonna do it?)
            </p>

            They'll get you anything with that evil smile
            Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
            Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
            Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
            I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
            Lip sync 'em every night, so I don't get 'em wrong
